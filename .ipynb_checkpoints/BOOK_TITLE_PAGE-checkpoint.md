### About This Book

This book teaches you to build machine learning systems for financial services that are:
- **Technically sound** (Code) - Production-quality implementations
- **Economically viable** (Capital) - Understand the business and regulatory context  
- **Ethically defensible** (Conscience) - Fair, explainable, and compliant

Whether you're a practitioner building systems or an instructor teaching the next generation of fintech engineers, this book provides the complete toolkit: working code, conceptual frameworks, regulatory guidance, and pedagogical scaffolding.

### Who This Book Is For

**Industry Practitioners:**
- ML Engineers building fintech systems
- Data Scientists working in financial services
- Risk Analysts and Quants
- Product Managers overseeing AI systems
- Compliance Officers evaluating models

**Academic Instructors:**
- Teaching "Responsible AI" or "AI Ethics"
- Teaching "Machine Learning in Finance"
- Teaching "Data Science for Business"
- Seeking hands-on, code-heavy curriculum
- Need complete teaching materials (exercises, rubrics, case studies)

**Students:**
- Computer Science with finance interest
- Data Science programs
- Business Analytics programs
- Self-learners preparing for fintech careers

### Prerequisites

- **Programming:** Python proficiency (pandas, scikit-learn)
- **Statistics:** Basic ML concepts (supervised learning, train/test split)
- **Finance:** No prior finance knowledge required (concepts explained)

### What Makes This Book Different

**Not just theory:** Every chapter includes complete, working code you can run immediately.

**Not just code:** Every technique is grounded in regulatory requirements and real-world case studies.

**Not just for practitioners:** Includes exercises, rubrics, teaching notes, and assessment materials.

**Not just for academics:** Code is production-quality, not toy examples.

**Dual-audience by design:** Industry practitioners and academic instructors both get what they need.
