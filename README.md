## 📖 About This Book

This repository contains the complete manuscript, code, and supporting materials for *Code, Capital, and Conscience: Building Fair Machine Learning Systems in Financial Services*.

**The book teaches you to build ML systems that are accurate, fair, and compliant with financial regulations.**

Whether you're a data scientist building models, a compliance officer validating them, or an executive overseeing AI strategy—this book meets you where you are.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Build a complete credit risk model** from raw data to production deployment
- **Measure fairness** using industry-standard metrics (DIR, SPD, EOD, calibration)
- **Mitigate bias** with practical techniques that actually work
- **Explain predictions** using SHAP for regulatory compliance
- **Monitor production systems** for fairness drift
- **Navigate regulations** including ECOA, FCRA, SR 11-7, and the EU AI Act

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/building-fair-ml.git
cd building-fair-ml
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Generate the Data

```bash
cd scripts
python generate_credit_data_STANDALONE.py
```

This creates:
- `synthetic_credit_data/raw/` — Messy data for Chapter 2 exercises
- `synthetic_credit_data/clean/` — Clean data for Chapter 3+ modeling

### 4. Start Reading!

- **Hands-on path:** Run the code as you read (15-20 hours)
- **Conceptual path:** Read explanations, skip code (6-8 hours)

## 🔧 Key Code Components

### Data Generation
```python
from scripts.generate_credit_data_STANDALONE import CreditDataGenerator

generator = CreditDataGenerator(n_accounts=1000, seed=42)
data = generator.generate_all()
```

### Fairness Metrics
```python
# Disparate Impact Ratio
dir_score = (y_pred[unprivileged] == 0).mean() / (y_pred[privileged] == 0).mean()

# Must be >= 0.80 to pass 4/5ths rule
```

### SHAP Explanations
```python
import shap
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
```
